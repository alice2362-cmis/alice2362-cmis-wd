1. Come into the classroom
2. Paste the command  git clone --config="http.proxy=http://alice2362:s0o2n0g3@192.168.2.1:8080" https://github.com/alice2362-cmis/alice2362-cmis-wd.git  onto terminal to clone. Click enter.
3. On terminal, type:  cd alice2362  and then tab, enter.
4. Type: gedit file.txt and click enter to create the file called file.txt.
5. Edit file.txt .
6. Save file.txt after that I've done editing it, and close the file.
7. Type:  git add file.txt  and enter, to make git aware of the file.
8. Type:  git commit -m "edited file.txt"  (or just any description of what change I've made to that file, between the two quotation marks). This just makes a 'snapshot' that I can always go back to if I mess up my work.
9. Type git push and type my github usrname (alice2362-cmis) and password in the appropriate places, and enter. This will send file.txt back to the git hub website.
10. Leave the classroom with a smile on your face.
